# Soccer Ball and Player OpenCV Object Recognition Project

## Project Description
Computer vision project designed to identify a soccer ball and players in a livestream of a soccer game. OpenCV is utilized to find differences in the contours of a frame a video passed into the program. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to install Python 3.* locally to properly run these files. You can use any package installer of your choosing
